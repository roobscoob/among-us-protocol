# `0x17` VotingComplete

This message is sent by the [`MeetingHud`](../05_innernetobject_types/01_meetinghud.md) object when voting has ended.

> **Note**: This message is sent from the host of a game to all clients via [`0x05` GameData](../02_root_message_types/05_gamedata.md).

| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packed uint32` | Vote States Length | The number of player voting states<br><br>**Note**: Regardless of how many players are in a game, this will always be `max(playerIds) + 1`<br><br>**Example**: If you have three players whose IDs are `0`, `3`, and `7`, the value of this field would be `8` |
| `byte[n]` | Vote States | A list of bitfields for each player's voting state, where length `n` is defined in the previous field<br><br>**Note**: For any vote state without a corresponding player, an empty byte (`0x00`) should be used<br><br>**Example**: Serializing players `0`, `3`, and `7` would result in `[0x??, 0x00, 0x00, 0x??, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x??]` where `0x??` is each player's serialized vote state and `0x00` are filler bytes |
| `byte` | Exiled Player ID | The ID of the player who was voted off<br><br>**Note**: This will be 255 (`0xff`) if no player was voted off |
| `boolean` | Is Tie | Whether or not the meeting ended with a tie in votes |

##### The `Vote States` Bitfield

To read the information in each player's `Vote State`, use the following bitwise operations.

| Name | Description | Operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Did Report | Whether or not the player called the meeting or found the body | `(state & 0x20) != 0` |
| Did Vote | Whether or not the player casted a vote, either to exile a player or to skip | `(state & 0x40) != 0` |
| Is Dead | Whether or not the player is dead | `(state & 0x80) != 0` |
| Voted For | The ID of the player that was voted to be exiled, or -1 if voting to skip | `(state & 0xf) - 1` |
